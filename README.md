<h3 align="center">Java, Spring Developer</h3>
<p>As a Software Developer and Architect, I specialize in object-oriented analysis and oversee every stage of the software development life cycle. From initial analysis and design to actual implementation and ongoing maintenance, I ensure that software systems are robust and efficient. My diverse experience includes working with various tools and technologies in N-tier and Microservices architectures. Some of the key components Iâ€™ve utilized include:</p>
<p>- Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Config for building scalable and resilient applications.</p>
<p>- Netflix OSS components such as Eureka, Zuul, and Hystrix for service discovery, routing, and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>- Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) for cloud-native deployment and management.</p>
